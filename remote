# Remote
# To run applications that needs UI/GUI remotely and starting them on the Windows system, 
do like these examples:

psexec \HOSTNAME -u USER -p PASSWORD -d -i 1 APPLICATION.exe

# To run batch scripts remotely, and without showing the cmd window, 
do like these examples:

psexec \HOSTNAME -u USER -p PASSWORD -d -i 1 C:/PSExecScripts/Quiet.exe C:/PSExecScripts/BATCH_FILE.bat

If you need to run an application like something.jar (java), use my example from this repository: 
https://github.com/urbancompasspony/SSH2Windows/blob/main/C:/PSExecScripts/Example.bat

You can run these commands automatically from Linux with: 
ssh USER@IP_ADDRESS "psexec \HOSTNAME -u USER -p PASSWORD -d -i 1 C:/PSExecScripts/Quiet.exe C:/PSExecScripts/BATCH_FILE.bat"
